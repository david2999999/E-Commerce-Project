Full stack development project with both front-end and backend. 
A considerable amount of work will be on developing the front-end code using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Thymeleaf, 
bootstrap and etc. Thymeleaf is the latest Java template engine, which is supposed to replace previous JSP way
(JSP is discontinued but is still being used out there) and it is the official template engine backed by Spring Framework, 
though it's not the only one you can choose. The backend side will be using latest Spring technologies - 
Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data and etc. Then, we will have MySQL as database. MySQL is powerful 
and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.
